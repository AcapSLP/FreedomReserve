When you inflate a currency or destroy a currency, the middle class gets wiped out, so the people who get to use the money first, which is created by the Federal Reserve System, benefit, so the money gravitates to the banks and to Wall Street.

 <button class="btn btn-error btn-ghost" id="problem">The Problem</button><br /><br />
  <p>In this century, the Britons face, once again, the virulent reign of the State - of the State now armed with the fruits of man's creative powers, confiscated and perverted to its own aims. The last few centuries were times when men tried to place limits on the State, only to find that such limits, as with all other attempts, have failed. Of all the numerous forms that governments have taken over the centuries, of all the concepts and institutions that have been tried, none has succeeded in keeping the State in check. The problem of the State is evidently as far from a solution as ever. Perhaps new paths of inquiry must be explored, if the final solution to the State is ever to be attained.</p>
  <p>As the State reaches the twilight of its life, we, as a people face intractable issues if we allow it to continue its monetary policies. The State, when seeking to continue its existence beyond what is mathematically possible will use the only tool in its economic arsenal available to it. That tool, is the creation of ever larger quantities of its fiat currency.  The use of this tool by the State against the people, will bring misery and ruin to the people of the British Isles. It is this serious affair with which we are now faced.</p>

<button class="btn btn-error btn-ghost" id="solution">The Solution: Separation of Money and State</button><br /><br />

<p>We all grow up going to school, where we learn about this thing that happened hundreds of years ago, which was the separation of church and state. We learn why that was so important, that humans used to live in societies under which their religion – something very personal and precious to them as individuals — was under the management of an organisation that could control those things. The State could tell you what to worship and how, when and why. Somehow, society realised perhaps that was unethical – that we shouldn’t permit control of something so personal and important to our lives to be controlled by the State.</p>

<p>It is that narrative of human development under which we now have other fights to fight, and in the realm of economics it is mainly the separation of money and State. Money is absolutely as fundamental to our lives as religion, and for many people it is far more fundamental to their lives than religion. It affects how your life unfolds. The choices that you make about money dictate the path of your life and those around you.  To have an institution like money controlled by a central entity — by a monopoly called the State — is absurd. It is immoral. <strong>We should get rid of it.</strong></p>
          
<div class="terminal-alert">We propose a new money for the people of the British Isles (England, Scotland, Wales, Ireland) Separated completely from the State. A money with a fixed supply. A zero rate of inflation, distributed fairly to the people who need it most; The young common worker of the British Isles.</div>

<h2 id="abstract">I. ABSTRACT</h2>



<p>The so-called 'Great Reset' has caused substantial disruption of the global economy. To attempt to preserve its stability, government central banks across the globe and particularly the UK, have significantly eased monetary policy by cutting interest rates and providing enormous liquidity to the money supply. However, fiscal and monetary policies implemented because of this economic crisis have exposed serious vulnerabilities in the UK financial system. Historically, increase in the supply of money causes inflation and reduces purchasing power. During economic recession, people tend to lose their trust in a centralised financial system and hedge inflation risks by investing in “store of value” assets that are expected to retain or increase their value over time.</p>



<h2 id="rise">II. THE RISE OF THE DECENTRALISED ECONOMY</h2>



<p>Our current financial system controlled by the Bank of England has an inherent problem: the goals of the bank can diverge from the goals of the majority of the people in the country. With the introduction of Bitcoin, it became clear that the governance system can function in a decentralised manner. Bitcoin introduced an innovative approach to processing payments without a trusted third party. The functions of the central bank have been replaced by open-source software where network participants vote with their computing power to determine whether a financial transaction is valid.</p>



<p>Ethereum, the second largest blockchain, allows its users to build decentralised financial applications. Whereas the traditional financial system is based on centralised infrastructure that is managed by authorities, institutions, and intermediaries, decentralised finance is governed by shared computing. By deploying smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain, it became possible to launch innovative financial products that are available to anyone. This sector is growing exponentially, and we will witness widespread global adoption of decentralised finance in the near future.</p>



<h2 id="demand">III. GROWING DEMAND FOR A DIGITAL STORE OF VALUE</h2>



<p>We expect the demand for decentralised “store of value” assets to rise considerably as the level of currency debasement increases. Institutional and individual investors are becoming more aware of serious flaws in the current financial system. This awareness will drive demand for non-correlated alternative asset classes and “store of value” assets, especially cryptocurrency assets. We're convinced that the monetary value and security of a store of value need not relate to any centralised power and cryptocurrency technology elegantly solves this problem.</p>



<p>Currently, gold and bitcoin are considered the most effective “store of value” assets. Both are not strongly correlated with traditional asset classes and retain their market value despite global economic downturns. However, bitcoin has significant advantages over gold due to its digital, decentralised nature and portability. At the same time, despite the fact that Bitcoin has an algorithmically predetermined limited supply, it has a deflationary economic model and its production will continue until ~2140.</p>



<h2 id="distribution">IV. <strong>FREEDOM RESERVE</strong> ECONOMIC MODEL AND DISTRIBUTION</h2>



<p>Freedom Reserve Coin (FRC) is designed as a decentralised digital store of value with a limited supply and a zero inflation rate. <strong>FREEDOM RESERVE</strong> was created during this time of economic upheaval with the purpose of offering people an alternative to fiat currency in these times of global economic recession and fiat debasement. The increasing demand for decentralised financial instruments may affect its adoption and usage.</p>

  </div>
  <br />

<p>The total supply of <strong>FREEDOM RESERVE</strong> is fixed at 80,000,000 coins. 80% of the <strong>FREEDOM RESERVE</strong> supply has been listed on decentralised exchanges with a nominal price of 0.000000036ETH/1FRC and an initial market capitalisation of ~£1,000. This was done with the intention of allowing early adopters to establish inexpensive exposure to <strong>FREEDOM RESERVE</strong> if they believe it will have a larger market in the future.</p>



<p><strong>FREEDOM RESERVE</strong> has a predetermined finite supply and no more additional <strong>FREEDOM RESERVE</strong> coins will ever be minted. The scarcity of <strong>FREEDOM RESERVE</strong> was embedded into the code and nothing can change it once the <strong>FREEDOM RESERVE</strong> smart contract is deployed on the Ethereum network. The token supply will not be artificially reduced either by buybacks or token burning.</p>



<p>Despite the intentionally small initial market capitalisation, we cannot predict whether <strong>FREEDOM RESERVE</strong> will retain its monetary value in the future. <strong>FREEDOM RESERVE</strong> may lose its value if it does not receive adoption as a digital store of value. At the same time, <strong>FREEDOM RESERVE</strong> value may rise because of the network effect, as more people believe in its intrinsic value and utility.</p>



<h2 id="adoption">V. ADOPTION PLAN</h2>


<p>Operating as a decentralised organisation, <strong>FREEDOM RESERVE</strong> is community controlled. Adoption will depend on the holders of the coin themselves promoting the coin as a store of value. Aside from those efforts the development fund of 20% of the supply will be used to fund an ongoing bounty program for guerrilla marketing efforts across the British Isles.</p>



<h2 id="conclusion">VI. CONCLUSION</h2>



<p>A new asset that has a limited supply and is extremely secure has true value. The fact that it is censorship-resistant and portable makes it more advanced than gold or fiat money. Because of the flaws in the current financial system, with its overvalued assets, leveraged products, and centralised manipulation, the demand for decentralised and censorship-resistant “store of value” assets will increase significantly.</p>



<p><strong>FREEDOM RESERVE</strong> has the potential to become a decentralised digital store of value with a zero inflation rate. The token is fully operational and its holders are immediately able to use it for its intended functionality on the Ethereum network. The <strong>FREEDOM RESERVE</strong> token structure and limited supply are embedded into the code and are designed to meet the needs of its holders. No one has managerial control over the <strong>FREEDOM RESERVE</strong> ecosystem nor provides essential managerial efforts that affect its success as <strong>FREEDOM RESERVE</strong> has a fully decentralised structure.</p>
